# Matrix-Game

Representing a project in process for Introduction to Robotics course, this task consists of using a matrix to create a mini-game, such as Snake or Bomberman and creates a perfect balance between software and hardware, helping to understand how the backstage of an actual game really works.

# Checkpoint 1

First phase is creating a Bomberman like game with a player, a (kind of) labyrinth and multiple bombs that the player can use to destroy the labyrinth walls with. The purpose of the game is to destroy the entire labyrinth as quick as possible. To tell apart the elements from one another, each one appears differently: the walls are represented by dots always lighting, the player is the dot slowly blinking and the bomb is accurately represented by a dot on the matrix that blinks rapidly, in a threatening way.
